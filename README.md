# Multi-Tenant, Sharded DBMS with Real-Time Analytics

## Scenario

You are tasked with designing and implementing a scalable, multi-tenant database management system (DBMS) for a global SaaS platform. The DBMS must support real-time analytics, tenant-specific sharding, and dynamic schema management.

## Requirements

### Multi-Tenant Support

- Implement tenant isolation through sharding. Each tenant's data should be stored in separate shards to ensure data privacy and performance isolation.
- Allow tenants to define custom schemas, with the system dynamically adjusting to changes in schema.

### Real-Time Analytics

- Design the system to support real-time analytics across tenants. The system should handle large volumes of analytical queries without impacting transaction processing.
- Implement a query optimization engine that can dynamically choose the best query execution plan based on the current system load and query patterns.

### Scalability & Performance

- Ensure that the system can scale horizontally, adding shards as new tenants are onboarded.
- Implement automated shard rebalancing to evenly distribute the load across available resources.

### Data Consistency & Availability

- Use distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure strong consistency across replicas.
- Implement high availability through data replication across multiple geographic regions.

### Backup & Recovery

- Design an automated backup and recovery system that supports point-in-time recovery for each tenant.
- Ensure that backup operations do not impact the performance of ongoing transactions and queries.

### Monitoring & Logging

- Implement tenant-specific monitoring and logging to track query performance, transaction latency, and system resource utilization.
- Set up real-time alerts for performance degradation, unusual query patterns, or potential data breaches.

### Security & Compliance

- Ensure that the system complies with global data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, by implementing tenant-specific encryption and access controls.
- Maintain audit logs to track all data access and modifications for each tenant.

### Benchmarking & Performance Testing

- Benchmark the system under various load scenarios, including high transaction volumes, large analytical workloads, and simultaneous tenant schema changes.
- Optimize the system to meet performance goals, such as sub-second query latency and near-linear scalability.
